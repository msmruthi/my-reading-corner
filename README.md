This repository contains HTML files for a website dedicated to my hobby of reading
* The website layout was designed using Tailwindcss with code generated by ChatGPT (Open AI)
* index.html is the landing page with a breif description of my reading journey
* top5.html is the page with my book recommendations across different genres/themes
* quotes.html is the page with some of my favourite lines from books I have read
* All the images of the book covers used are downloaded from Goodreads and are the property of their respective publishers and authors

Note - the github pages site is best viewed on laptop or desktop for now. I am still working on adapting the site to a phone display.
